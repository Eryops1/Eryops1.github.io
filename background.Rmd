"Most amphibia are abhorrent because of their cold body, pale colour, cartilaginous skeleton, filthy skin, fierce aspect, calculating eye, offensive smell, harsh voice, squalid habitation, and terrible venom; and so their Creator has not exerted his powers (to make) them many of them," (Linnaeus 1758)

# Amphibians and extinction risk
Amphibians are the most endangered terrestrial vertebrate group [1]. Several studies examined biological as well as environmental and also anthropogenic factors, that can potentially add to extinction risk [2]. Typical influential factors are the geographic range size and bodysize of a species, which have been confirmed in studies on fossils from extinct species as well [3].

Although amphibians are one of the most threatened groups today, their fossil record and therefore the past of amphibians is rarely taken into account. As the fossil record offers to study real extinction events instead of making estimations about the risk, the fossil record of extinct species can give valuable information about factors influencing a species survival.


# My work
Part of my PhD project is to create a model, based on the fossil record of amphibians, which identifies important traits that influence extinction risk. This model is going to be applied to living amphibians to compare the predicted extinction risk with the risk category they got assigned by the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/amphibians).
