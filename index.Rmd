I am Melanie Tietje, a biologist currently working at the [Natural History Museum in Berlin](https://www.naturkundemuseum.berlin/en/einblicke/mitarbeiter/melanie.tietje), Germany. I am interested in the possibilities of combining neontological and paleontological data to learn from past events about our possible future. I pursue this interest in my PhD project, in which I work on traits that influence extinction risk in fossil and modern amphibian species.

This webpage gives an overview about my interests and projects.
