# Climate and amphibians
In the coming decades we might face the loss of more than 50% of the climatic ranges for more than 
half  of  plants  and  34%  of  animals  [1].  Abrupt  greenhouse‐driven  climate  change  and  synergistic 
effects,  e.g.  disrupted  migration  pathways  and  breeding  cycles,  changing  predator,  competitor  and 
prey  relations,  habitat‐loss  as  well  as  diseases,  are  significant  contributors  to  this  biodiversity 
destruction.  Although  often  ignored  from  a  public  perspective,  or  considered  to  be  of  lesser 
importance  than  likeable  flagship  species,  amphibians  alongside  reptiles  might  face  greatest 
extinction risk under current changing climate [2].

This project aims at connecting changing climatic conditions and temporal trends in amphibian 
traits, including extinction risk and diversity, to  expand  our  knowledge  about  current  and  future  extinction  threats to amphibians. The project uses oxygen isotope data to reconstruct the relative temperature changes as well as latitudinal temperature gradients.

# Extinction risk in fossil and living amphibians
## Background
<!--
"Most amphibia are abhorrent because of their cold body, pale colour, cartilaginous skeleton, filthy skin, fierce aspect, calculating eye, offensive smell, harsh voice, squalid habitation, and terrible venom; and so their Creator has not exerted his powers (to make) them many of them," (Linnaeus 1758)
-->
Amphibians are the most endangered terrestrial vertebrate group [1]. Several studies examined biological as well as environmental and also anthropogenic factors, that can potentially add to extinction risk [2]. Typical influential factors are the geographic range size and bodysize of a species, which have been confirmed in studies on fossils from extinct species as well [3].

Although amphibians are one of the most threatened groups today, their fossil record and therefore the past of amphibians is rarely taken into account. As the fossil record offers to study real extinction events instead of making estimations about the risk, the fossil record of extinct species can give valuable information about factors influencing a species survival.

## My work
Part of my PhD project is to create a model, based on the fossil record of amphibians, which identifies important traits that influence extinction risk. This model is going to be applied to living amphibians to compare the predicted extinction risk with the risk category they got assigned by the [IUCN Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/amphibians).

# Fellow Program Open Science

Besides bridging the gap between the fossil record and current biology in my PhD work, I am interested in different concepts of Open Science. This website was initialized as part of my work as a fellow in the [Open Science Fellow Program](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/Fellowprogramm). Launched for the first time in 2016 by Wikimedia Germany and Stifterverband the fellow program enables 10 scientists from different areas to open up their research by providing guidance and financial support.

I created this website as part of my work in the [Open Science Fellow Program](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/BildungWissenschaftKultur/Fellowprogramm/Fellows). Open Science needs communication, and what better way could there be than making your science explorable online? While learning to use GitHub, I stumbled across GitHub Pages, which resulted in this webpage.

As part of my project in the fellow program, I concentrate of the aspects reproducibility, community feedback and open publishing. If you are looking for inspiration on how you can make your own research more open, the [Vienna Principles](http://viennaprinciples.org/) offer some ideas.

## Reproducibility 
Making your research reproducible is part of good scientific practice. Therefore, I want to publish the R scripts used in my analysis together with the data and the manuscript. This can be part of the electronic supplement but can also be hosted independently on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Community feedback
Getting feedback on your work when it comes to peer review is good, but getting feedback even earlier, while it is still in progress, might speed up the whole process. Reaching out to your research community gets you valuable tips on your work. However, this costs time (as building this webpage for example). Therefore a part of my project is the evaluation of opening up your research in terms of costs and benefits.

## Open publishing and preprints 
Publishing my work in an open access journal will be the last milestone in this project, but before that I plan on something way more interesting. I want to test preprint and preprint servers, which is something that, for biology or paleontology, is sparsely used in my surroundings. Finding the right preprint server to adress the right crowd as well as responding to hopefully plenty of feedback will be valuable experiences and will likely add to quality and make the publication process a bit easier in the end. 

Another option in the peer review process is aiming at a journal that offers open peer review, which is getting more and more common and adds to the transparency in the review process.
